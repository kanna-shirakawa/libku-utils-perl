# perl-utils
a bunch of perl code snippets, for lazy programmers, at the moment:

- ku-utils.pl (installed in perl5 vendor dir)
	some usefull functions that I use almost in every script,
	debug messaging and argument check, date and time formatting

- ku-cgilib.pl (installed in perl5 vendor dir)
	a simple library to parse cgi-bin scripts arguments, and to
	simplify the page output process

- freedb (installed as samplfile in package docs directory)
	a simple web, filesystem and textfiles, key/value based
	database, usefull to permament save and retrieve small
	pieces of data via web interface

- age (installed in /usr/bin)
	a command that prints human readably format the elapsed time
	(in seconds or other units); a perl script used as example
	of ku-utils.pl functions
