# perl-utils
a bunch of perl code snippets, for lazy programmers, at the moment:

- ku-utils.pl (installed in perl5 vendor dir)
	some usefull functions that I use almost in every script,
	debug messaging and argument check, date and time formatting

- ku-cgilib.pl (installed in perl5 vendor dir)
	a simple library to parse cgi-bin scripts arguments, and to
	simplify the page output process

- freedb (installed as samplfile in package docs directory)
	a simple web, filesystem and textfile, key/value based
	database, usefull to permament save and retrieve small
	pieces of data via web interface

NOTE: that this is my first attempt to place my projects on github,
and I'm using it, among other tasks, to test my automatic rebuild
tools suite (jtools).
